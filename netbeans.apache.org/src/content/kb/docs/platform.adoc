== What is the NetBeans Platform?

The NetBeans Platform is a broad Java framework on which you can base large desktop applications. 

See link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NetBeans-based_software[a list of NetBeans based applications]
that have been built on top of the NetBeans platform.

NOTE: The fact that we use the NetBeans Platform to build the NetBeans IDE does not mean that
you can only build IDEs with it. People design planes, manage airports and harbors, manage satellite
earth stations, build passenger information systems, design radar systems, play music, paint complex
graphs and more using the NetBeans Platform.

The NetBeans Platform contains APIs that simplify the handling of windows,
actions, files, user selection and many other things typical in desktop based
applications. This greatly makes things easier for you, reducing the
time-to-market required to create great applications.

Of course great power comes with great responsiblity, so you have to learn
how to use the NetBeans Platform before taking advantage of its full potential.
This page may be of help.

== Reference

This section contains links to books, refcards, blogs and videos that you
may consider useful while learning the NetBeans Platform.

=== Books

This is a list of books that may help you get started. Some of them are
somewhat old, but NetBeans main concepts have not evolved that much, and most

=== Extending the NetBeans Platform

The NetBeans module system is very extensible, meaning that you can add
features through different mechanisms: the Java's service provider interface, the
Lookup API (that also works with the service provider interface) and the
concept of "layers" (that works in a similar way to the Windows registry).

* For an introduction to the Java Service Provider mechanism see Oracle's link:https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/extensible.html[+Creating Extensible Applications With the Java Platform+]
* For an introduction to the NetBeans Lookup API see link:http://netbeans.dzone.com/articles/netbeans-lookups-explained[+NetBeans Lookups Explained!+].

* The link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/layers.html[+Description of Layer Registrations in NetBeans APIs+] explains how each module
in NetBeans registers files, documents, classes and more in a global registry that you can query.

=== Using Maven to build applications

You can use Maven and the NetBeans Platform to build great applications. Here're some
tutorials to get you started:

=== NetBeans APIs for Visualizing Data

The NetBeans Platform has a powerful library (called the "NetBeans Visual Library") that you can use
to build complex user-interactive visualizations.

* link:https://netbeans.org/community/magazine/html/04/visuallibrary.html[+Creative Uses of the Visual Library+]

=== Building custom project types

Since we use the NetBeans Platform to build the NetBeans IDE, we use objects known as "Projects" to represent
Java, PHP or C/C++ "projects".

You can use "projects" to represent a set of files or concepts organized in a hierarchy. Be either the list of
rails in a train station, or a hierarchy of parts of a component you're designing.

These tutorials explain how to extend existing project types or to create your own.

* link:https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-projectextension.html[+Project Type Extension Module Tutorial+]
* link:https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-projecttype.html[+Project Type Module Tutorial+]

=== Templates

We use "templates" to create files with some predefined content.

=== Installers

* link:https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-nbi.html[+Installer Integration Tutorial+]

* link:https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-options.html[+Options Window Module Tutorial+]

=== Property editors

When you select an object in your application, the "Property Editor" window automatically shows
the properties of the object. Be it a plane, a train or a satellite.
