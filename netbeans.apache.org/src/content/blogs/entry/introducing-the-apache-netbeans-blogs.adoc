Here, at last, is a community space for everyone working on Apache NetBeans, currently incubating, to post blogs.

I imagine this will be a place where we can announce new releases of Apache NetBeans, while it will also be a place for everyone to share their experiences and make all kinds of other announcements.

//For example, did you know there's already an application created on top of Apache NetBeans? It is called YaMeter, read about it here.

Happy blogging everyone, at the brand new Apache NetBeans (incubating) blog.
