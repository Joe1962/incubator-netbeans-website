Hi all. Today, we will briefly show you about PHP7.3 support which will be available in the *next NetBeans version* i.e. *NetBeans 10*.

First of all, I strongly hope that new features are tested by PHP users before NetBeans 10 is released because there should be bugs.
Definitely, need your help!
If you are interested in them, just test them. You can download a dev version here.

== PHP 7.3 Support

To enable it, you have to set PHP 7.3 as the PHP version of your PHP project.

NetBeans provides support for the new three syntaxes.

=== Allow a trailing comma in function calls

=== list() Referenct Assignment

=== Flexible Heredoc and Nowdoc Syntaxes

NOTE: We won't provide support for the old syntax any longer. i.e. NetBeans treats the following code as an error.

[source,php]
----
$heredoc = <<< END
END{$variable}
END;
----

== PHP 7.1, 7.2 and more PHP features

The other PHP features for NetBeans 10 are link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Feature%3A+PHP[here].

We have also implemented PHP7.1, 7.2, new hints, new code foldings and more.

That's all for today. As always, please test it. You can download a development version from Jenkins Build.

If you find some issues or enhancements, please report them to JIRA with your exact steps to reproduce them.
(Components: php - Editor). Thanks.
